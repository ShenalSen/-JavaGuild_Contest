Hey everyone!

I hope you're all enjoying your summer break!
As we move closer to next Level5 and the Industry placement year,
it's important to keep our coding and problem solving skills sharp regardless if you pursue a Software engineer role or not.
To help with this, We've planned a weekly coding challenge that will keep us engaged.

Here's the plan:

Weekly Challenges: Every week, We'll share 2-4 questions sourced from HackerRank or LeetCode.
The questions will be hosted on HackerRank.

Solve and Share: You can solve these questions at your own pace using either Java or Python and upload your solutions to your GitHub profile.
(More commits mean more green activity in your GitHub profile).

Discussion and Support: If you encounter any difficulties or have questions,
Everyone is encouraged to discuss concerns and solutions in the group.


Why participate?

Stay Sharp: Keep your problem solving, coding skills sharp over the summer.

Get Noticed: An active GitHub profile with regular contributions is highly attractive to recruiters.

Collaborate and Learn: Engage with a community of like-minded peers to solve problems and share knowledge.

Let's make the most of this summer and prepare ourselves for a successful placement season ahead! ðŸš€
